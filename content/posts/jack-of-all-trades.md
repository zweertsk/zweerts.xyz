I had a job interview once, for a software development position, in which we were discussing my areas of interest. Following with
the experiences I had regarding those interests. I have a broad scope of interests. I'm like a dog running around chasing stuff.
I got the question what my speciality is, and essentially calling me the jack of all trades but master of none.
I wish I had read the following piece before I had the interview.

**What makes a pragmatic programmer?**
> "You try hard to be familiar with a broad
range of technologies and environments, and you work to keep abreast of
new developments. Although your current job may require you to be a
specialist, you will always be able to move on to new areas and new
challenges.‚Äù [^1]
